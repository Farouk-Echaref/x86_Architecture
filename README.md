# x86 Architecture 

## CPU Archi
- (I/O Devices) <=> (CPU: Registers <=> Arithmetic Logic Unit <=> Control Unit) <=> (Main Memory RAM)
- Control Unit => takes instructions from RAM, EIP (Instruction Pointer)
- Arithmetic Logic Unit => Executes instructions and stores results in Registers or RAM
- Registers => CPU Storage
- RAM => contains code and data for a program to run, CPU access it one instruction at time
- I/O

- En bref: When a program has to be executed, it is loaded into the memor, from there, the Control Unit fetches one instruction at a time, using the Instruction Pointer Register, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit executes it,the results are either stored in the Registers or the RAM.

## Registers
- <mark> Instruction Pointer </mark>: pointer to the next instruction to be executed by the CPU.(EIP for 32bit, RIP for 64bit)

- <mark>General-Purpose Registers</mark>:
